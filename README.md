# Morse-Code-Signalling-
 


Overview

This project demonstrates text communication using Morse code encoding and decoding. Characters are converted into Morse signals (dots and dashes), which are transmitted using LEDs/buzzer and can be decoded back into readable text. It is implemented with Arduino for real-time signalling in low-bandwidth or emergency communication.

Features

Convert text to Morse code signals

Transmit Morse code using LED and/or buzzer

Decode Morse signals back into readable text

Real-time communication with Arduino

Technologies Used

-Arduino Uno

-LED & Buzzer

-Resistors, jumper wires

-Arduino IDE

Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I learned:

Basics of Morse code encoding and decoding

Handling real-time signals with Arduino

Implementing communication in low-bandwidth systems.

Acknowledgement & Notes

This project is inspired by online tutorials (YouTube/Arduino resources), and I have adapted and customized it for my learning. It was developed as part of our college project expo and the ppt template belongs to our college St.Joseph's Institute of Technology
